# AI-Assisted Text Classification API

## 📌 Overview

The **AI-Assisted Text Classification API** is a backend service built using **Java** and **Spring Boot** that classifies user-provided text into one of the following categories:

- **Complaint**
- **Query**
- **Feedback**
- **Other**

The classification is performed using a **Large Language Model (LLM)** via the **Groq API**, ensuring intelligent, context-aware categorization instead of traditional rule-based keyword matching.

This project demonstrates how to design, integrate, and expose an **AI-powered backend service** using clean architecture and REST principles.

## ✨ Features

- RESTful API with a single POST endpoint  
- AI-driven text classification (no hard-coded rules)  
- Integration with Groq’s OpenAI-compatible API  
- Clear separation of controller and service layers  
- Graceful error handling with safe defaults  
- Easily testable using Postman or any REST client

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java 21  
- **Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **AI Provider:** Groq API (OpenAI-compatible)  
- **HTTP Client:** Spring WebClient  
- **JSON Parsing:** Jackson

## 🎯 Key Design Principles

- Business logic is isolated in the **service layer**
- AI is responsible for **all classification decisions**
- Backend only validates and normalizes AI output
- No rule-based categorization in Java code

## 📡 API Specification

### Endpoint

POST /api/classify

### Request Headers
Content-Type: application/json


### Request Body
```json
{
  "text": "Your input text here"
}
### Response Body
{
  "category": "Complaint | Query | Feedback | Other"
}
🧠 Classification Logic (AI-Driven)

The AI model classifies text based on semantic meaning, not keywords.

Category	Description
Complaint	Problems, issues, dissatisfaction
Query	Questions or requests for information
Feedback	Explicit praise or opinions
Other	Greetings, small talk, neutral messages
Examples

"The app crashes when I pay" → Complaint

"How can I reset my password?" → Query

"Great app, works smoothly" → Feedback

"Hello there" → Other

⚠️ Error Handling Strategy

If the AI API:

fails

times out

returns unexpected output

Then:

The service safely returns "Other"

No assumptions or rule-based guessing are applied

This guarantees API stability under all conditions.

⚙️ Environment Setup
Prerequisites

Java 21 installed

Maven installed

Groq API key

Configuration
application.properties
ai.api.key=MY_GROQ_API_KEY


⚠️ Important:
Never commit real API keys to GitHub.
Use environment variables or local configuration for production.

▶️ Running the Application
mvn spring-boot:run


The application will start at:

http://localhost:8080

🧪 Testing the API
Using Postman

POST REQUEST

http://localhost:8080/api/classify

{ "text": "The app crashes every time I try to pay" }
{ "text": "How can I change my email address?" }
{ "text": "The new update is amazing, great work!" }
{ "text": "Hello there" }

Sample Responses

{ "category": "Complaint" }
{ "category": "Query" }
{ "category": "Feedback" }
{ "category": "Other" }


🚀 Why Groq?

Groq provides:

OpenAI-compatible APIs

Extremely fast inference

Stable free-tier usage

Simple integration with OpenAI-style requests

This makes it ideal for backend AI integrations.
